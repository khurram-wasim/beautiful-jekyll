If you are looking to fulfil your web development needs be it front end or back I am your man.I have had extensive experience in development of over 5 years with javascript frameworks; Angular JS , React JS and Node JS. If your need is to have awesome website design with and a seamless user experience you have came to the right place.

I am fluent in Bootstrap which makes it developing responsive web design a walk in the park. Apart from that Wordpress is a part and parcel of my life with wordpress plugin development of particular interest. Over time I have diversified my skills into chrome apps and chrome extensions. When it comes to settings sprints and tickets Jira or Asana would be the tool to use and to wrap it all Slack would be a go to for communication between us.
